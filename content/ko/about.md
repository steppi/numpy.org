NumPy는 Python을 통해 수치적 컴퓨팅을 할 수 있도록 도와주는 오픈소스 프로젝트입니다. Numerical와 Numarray라는 라이브러리의 초기 작업을 기반으로 2005년에 만들어졌습니다. NumPy will always be 100% open source software and free for all to use. It is released under the liberal terms of the [modified BSD license](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/blob/main/LICENSE.txt).

NumPy is developed in the open on GitHub, through the consensus of the NumPy and wider scientific Python community. For more information on our governance approach, please see our [Governance Document](https://www.numpy.org/devdocs/dev/governance/index.html).
