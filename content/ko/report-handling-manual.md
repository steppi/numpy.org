NumPy 행동 강령 위원회는 본 설명을 따릅니다. 문제를 해결할 때 일관성과 공정성을 확보하기 위한 지침입니다.

[행동 강령](/code-of-conduct)을 시행하면 현재와 미래의 커뮤니티에 영향을 미칩니다. 우리가 가볍게 받아들이지 않는 행동입니다. 집행 조치를 검토할 때 행동 강령 위원회는 다음 가치와 지침을 염두에 둘 것입니다.

* 비인간적이기보다는 개인적인 방식으로 행동하십시오. 위원회는 신고자의 사생활과 필요한 기밀을 존중하면서 상황을 이해하도록 당사자들을 참여시킬 수 있습니다. 그러나 때때로 한 명 이상의 개인과 직접 소통해야 할 필요가 있습니다. 위원회의 목표는 단지 공식적인 결정을 내리는 것이 아니라 우리 지역 사회의 건강을 개선하는 것입니다.
* 행동을 판단하기보다는 개인에 대한 공감을 강조하고 "좋음"과 "나쁨/악"이라는 이분법적인 레이블을 피하십시오. 노골적이고 분명한 공격성과 괴롭힘이 존재하며 우리는 단호하게 대처할 것입니다. 그러나 해결하기 어려운 것으로 입증될 수 있는 많은 시나리오는 정상적인 불일치가 여러 당사자의 도움이 되지 않거나 해로운 행동으로 귀결되는 시나리오입니다. 전체 맥락을 이해하고 모두를 다시 참여시키는 경로를 찾는 것은 어렵지만 궁극적으로 우리 커뮤니티에 가장 생산적입니다.
* 우리는 이메일이 어려운 매체이며 고립될 수 있음을 이해합니다. 개인적인 연락 없이 이메일을 통해 비판을 받는 것은 특히 고통스러울 수 있습니다. 따라서 다른 사람의 견해를 열린 마음으로 존중하는 분위기를 유지하는 것이 특히 중요합니다. 또한 투명하게 행동해야 하며 모든 구성원이 공정하고 공감하는 대우를 받을 수 있도록 최선을 다하겠다는 의미이기도 합니다.
* 차별은 미묘할 수도 있고 무의식적일 수도 있습니다. 일상적인 상호 작용에서 불공평과 적대감으로 나타날 수 있습니다. 저희는 이런 차별이 발생한다는 점을 인지하고 있으며 주의를 기울이고 조심할 것입니다. 저희는 귀하가 부당한 대우를 받았다고 느끼시는 경우 귀하의 의견을 듣고 싶습니다. 귀하의 불만 사항을 듣고 해결하기 위한 절차를 밟을 것입니다.
* 좋은 토론 관행에 참여를 늘리도록 도와주세요: 토론이 중단되었을 수 있는 부분을 파악하고 이러한 점에서 긍정적인 변화를 가져올 수 있는 실행 가능한 정보, 포인터 및 리소스를 제공하세요.
* 신입 회원의 필요를 염두에 두십시오. 특히 소외된 그룹의 참여를 늘리는 것을 목표로 명시적인 지원과 배려를 제공하십시오.
* 개인은 서로 다른 문화적 배경과 모국어를 가지고 있습니다. 원어민이 아닌 사람으로 인한 정직한 오해를 식별하고 문제를 이해하고 불쾌감을 주지 않도록 변경할 수 있는 사항을 이해하도록 돕습니다. 외국어로 복잡한 토론을 하는 것은 매우 위협적일 수 있으며 국적과 문화를 넘어 다양성을 키우고자 합니다.


## 중재

Voluntary informal mediation is a tool at our disposal. In contexts such as when two or more parties have all escalated to the point of inappropriate behavior (something sadly common in human conflict), it may be useful to facilitate a mediation process. This is only an example: the Committee can consider mediation in any case, mindful that the process is meant to be strictly voluntary and no party can be pressured to participate. If the Committee suggests mediation, it should:

* Find a candidate who can serve as a mediator.
* Obtain the agreement of the reporter(s). The reporter(s) have complete freedom to decline the mediation idea or to propose an alternate mediator.
* Obtain the agreement of the reported person(s).
* Settle on the mediator: while parties can propose a different mediator than the suggested candidate, only if a common agreement is reached on all terms can the process move forward.
* Establish a timeline for mediation to complete, ideally within two weeks.

The mediator will engage with all the parties and seek a resolution that is satisfactory to all. Upon completion, the mediator will provide a report (vetted by all parties to the process) to the Committee, with recommendations on further steps. The Committee will then evaluate these results (whether a satisfactory resolution was achieved or not) and decide on any additional action deemed necessary.


## How the Committee will respond to reports

When the Committee (or a Committee member) receives a report, they will first determine whether the report is about a clear and severe breach (as defined below). If so, immediate action needs to be taken in addition to the regular report handling process.


## Clear and severe breach actions

We know that it is painfully common for internet communication to start at or devolve into obvious and flagrant abuse. We will deal quickly with clear and severe breaches like personal threats, violent, sexist or racist language.

When a member of the Code of Conduct Committee becomes aware of a clear and severe breach, they will do the following:

* Immediately disconnect the originator from all NumPy communication channels.
* Reply to the reporter that their report has been received and that the originator has been disconnected.
* In every case, the moderator should make a reasonable effort to contact the originator, and tell them specifically how their language or actions qualify as a “clear and severe breach”. The moderator should also say that, if the originator believes this is unfair or they want to be reconnected to NumPy, they have the right to ask for a review, as below, by the Code of Conduct Committee. The moderator should copy this explanation to the Code of Conduct Committee.
* The Code of Conduct Committee will formally review and sign off on all cases where this mechanism has been applied to make sure it is not being used to control ordinary heated disagreement.


## Report handling

When a report is sent to the Committee they will immediately reply to the reporter to confirm receipt. This reply must be sent within 72 hours, and the group should strive to respond much quicker than that.

If a report doesn’t contain enough information, the Committee will obtain all relevant data before acting. The Committee is empowered to act on the Steering Council’s behalf in contacting any individuals involved to get a more complete account of events.

The Committee will then review the incident and determine, to the best of their ability:

* What happened.
* Whether this event constitutes a Code of Conduct violation.
* Who are the responsible party(ies).
* Whether this is an ongoing situation, and there is a threat to anyone’s physical safety.

This information will be collected in writing, and whenever possible the group’s deliberations will be recorded and retained (i.e. chat transcripts, email discussions, recorded conference calls, summaries of voice conversations, etc).

It is important to retain an archive of all activities of this Committee to ensure consistency in behavior and provide institutional memory for the project. To assist in this, the default channel of discussion for this Committee will be a private mailing list accessible to current and future members of the Committee as well as members of the Steering Council upon justified request. If the Committee finds the need to use off-list communications (e.g. phone calls for early/rapid response), it should in all cases summarize these back to the list so there’s a good record of the process.

The Code of Conduct Committee should aim to have a resolution agreed upon within two weeks. In the event that a resolution can’t be determined in that time, the Committee will respond to the reporter(s) with an update and projected timeline for resolution.


## Resolutions

The Committee must agree on a resolution by consensus. If the group cannot reach consensus and deadlocks for over a week, the group will turn the matter over to the Steering Council for resolution.

Possible responses may include:

* Taking no further action:
  -   if we determine no violations have occurred;
  -   if the matter has been resolved publicly while the Committee was considering responses.
* Coordinating voluntary mediation: if all involved parties agree, the Committee may facilitate a mediation process as detailed above.
* Remind publicly, and point out that some behavior/actions/language have been judged inappropriate and why in the current context, or can but hurtful to some people, requesting the community to self-adjust.
* A private reprimand from the Committee to the individual(s) involved. In this case, the group chair will deliver that reprimand to the individual(s) over email, cc’ing the group.
* A public reprimand. In this case, the Committee chair will deliver that reprimand in the same venue that the violation occurred, within the limits of practicality. E.g., the original mailing list for an email violation, but for a chat room discussion where the person/context may be gone, they can be reached by other means. The group may choose to publish this message elsewhere for documentation purposes.
* A request for a public or private apology, assuming the reporter agrees to this idea: they may at their discretion refuse further contact with the violator. The chair will deliver this request. The Committee may, if it chooses, attach “strings” to this request: for example, the group may ask a violator to apologize in order to retain one’s membership on a mailing list.
* A “mutually agreed upon hiatus” where the Committee asks the individual to temporarily refrain from community participation. If the individual chooses not to take a temporary break voluntarily, the Committee may issue a “mandatory cooling off period”.
* A permanent or temporary ban from some or all NumPy spaces (mailing lists, gitter.im, etc.). The group will maintain records of all such bans so that they may be reviewed in the future or otherwise maintained.

Once a resolution is agreed upon, but before it is enacted, the Committee will contact the original reporter and any other affected parties and explain the proposed resolution. The Committee will ask if this resolution is acceptable, and must note feedback for the record.

Finally, the Committee will make a report to the NumPy Steering Council (as well as the NumPy core team in the event of an ongoing resolution, such as a ban).

The Committee will never publicly discuss the issue; all public statements will be made by the chair of the Code of Conduct Committee or the NumPy Steering Council.


## Conflicts of Interest

In the event of any conflict of interest, a Committee member must immediately notify the other members, and recuse themselves if necessary.
